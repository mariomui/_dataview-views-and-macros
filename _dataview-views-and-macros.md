    * [ ] Alias or aliases do not change when folder change.
    * [ ] Folder pages change with the folder renaming

- [ ] All tag pages and folder pages aside from the top level  A_ B_ C_ D_...Z_ will be prefixed with an underscore. 
This folder is a sandbox for dataview "static" pages. Static pages are post processed and will be shared. 

The code stays off the primary note but the transcluded preview is available. This works well for dynamically generate hotkey pages.

The reason for the folder is to cordon off the universe. The folder ==`= split(this.file.path,"/")[0]`== will be primarily used for candidate features.
